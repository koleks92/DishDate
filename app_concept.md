# DishDate App Concept

## App Concept

**DishDate** is a fun, interactive app where two users (or more in the future) go through a set of dish cards, swiping left or right based on their preferences. The app then shows how many dishes they both liked, helping people bond over shared tastes in food.

## Features and Screens

    -   Email login

### 2. Main Screen

-   **Profile Button**: Takes users to their profile settings where they can update their information.

### 5. Game Setup Screen

    -   **Select Number of Dishes**: Choose a range (6 to 24 dishes) for the session.
    -   **Select Dish Database**: Choose between built-in dishes or user-created dishes (customizable).

-   **Once Both Users Are In**: Automatically moves to the game screen when both players have joined with the same ID.

### 6. Game Screen

-   **Dish Cards**:
    -   Displays one dish at a time on a card with:
        -   **Dish Name**
        -   **Dish Image**
        -   **Short Description**
    -   Users can swipe:
        -   **Right** to “Like”
        -   **Left** to “Pass”

    - If **Join Game**: Enter the game ID provided by another player.
4. **Game Session**:

## Technical Considerations

-   **Database Structure**:

    -   **Dishes Database**: Includes both built-in dishes and custom user-created dishes.
    -   **Game Sessions**: Temporary storage for active games, tracking users, dish choices, and matches.
    -   **Users**: Store profile information and personal dish databases.

-   **Real-time or Turn-based Matchmaking**:
    -   Use a real-time database (like Firebase) or API to sync choices and update game sessions in real-time.
